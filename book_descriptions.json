As we strive for perfection (Philippians 3:12-14), our witness will be enhanced, our spiritual life will deepen, our lights will shine brighter, longer, more consistently and more purely, and the grace of God will enrich us in our journeys. There is a path laid out for us here, and I want to take it, examine it more closely, and share it. I am not perfect, and I know it very well, but I want to do better, I want to increase!

I want to go forward!\" Supplement Your Faith: A Pathway to Integrity takes us on a course that encourages us to pursue seven particular qualities, or, character traits that enable us to be effective and productive in our knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Fourteen young women have turned up dead in the Sherman forest, near the Sherman Estates, which now involves the old family with its dark and scandals past. Donovan and the Jackson Hole Sheriffs department must follow the clues, which are nearly identical to a case his father worked thirty years ago. But because of old biases and bigotry, as well as backward thinking, it had cost his father his life and could cost him his too. In the process, Donovan will dig into old family histories, secrets, and long dead skeletons, at the same time inquire into the current dark private sultry side of the community. Will he be able to solve the case before the Sherriff closes it as he did thirty years ago, and save his daughters in the process? It could rock the town, but hopefully not break it, and finally bring it into the twentieth-first century even if it does not want it."

Now, in the year 2273, Bowers has landed right in the middle of a coup and conspiracy by the Earth president and his ex-admiral, his former commander. Both do not care whom they hurt and wish to use the newly acquired alien technology, which they found in the Andromeda Galaxy, for their own profit and power. This brings Bowers right back into the middle of his ex-admiral's newest agenda. To complete his original mission, to save Earth and Mars, Bowers will need to stop his ex-admiral, the coup, and the ancient force he has awoken. First, he must remember who he is, from his memory loss, because of the lost time due to losing the ten years. Bowers and his new team, one at first that does not accept him for who is and believes he is causing the calamities and not the ancient force or his ex-admiral, must now work together. As the conspiracy unfolds, will a current admiral and old family friends learn in time what is going on and help him stop the ancient force and the coup and to complete his original mission to help Earth and Mars?"

What began as a four-year hitch lasted nearly thirty-six years and included an interesting assortment of duty stations and assignments as both enlisted and officer. We'll All Die As Marines narrates a story about a young, free-spirited kid from Dundalk, Maryland, and how the Corps captured his body, mind, and spirit. Slowly, but persistently, the Corps transformed him into someone whose first love would forever be the United States Marine Corps. It documents not only his leadership, service, and training but also regales many tales of his fellow Marines that will have the reader laughing, cheering, and at times crying. In this memoir, Bathurst reveals that for him-a former DI who was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V,\" Purple Heart, and a combat commission to second lieutenant-the Corps was not a job, a career, or even a profession; it was-and still is-a way of life."

Instead, I share my reflections about themes that emerged in my work as a professional in a nursing home. At times, I will share my own experiences to illustrate a point. This book is written as an invitation to guide readers to lift the veil into what could be viewed as a complex process-that is, the aging process. While we are all headed toward this developmental benchmark as we grow older; the path of aging influences us all. This book is not psychotherapy, and residents are not identified as case studies. Rather, the aim of this book is for readers to reflect on the themes highlighted in each chapter. It is as if we are sitting together and exchanging viewpoints about the various thematic chapters in this book. In each chapter, I use metaphors to underscore my observations. The book's format is divided into chapters. Each chapter has a title and a subtitle describing each theme as a jewel. To understand this, picture yourself sitting in your favorite chair with a cup of tea and reading a chapter in this book. Questions poised in the chapters in this book are questions that I reflected on in my own discovery about aging, and thus, I feel compelled to share them with you. Since a jewel is the subtitle of each chapter, why not experiment and develop your own treasure chest? There are numerous arts and crafts stores that carry boxes that can be decorated to resemble a treasure chest, as we all have the ability to be creative. Further, as part of this process, consider choosing a favorite color or colors as your own personal jewel(s), place it inside your personalized treasure chest, and pour your hopes, dreams, and aspirations onto it. It is surprising what this process may reveal! Even more, imagine having your own treasure chest, and as you raise the lid, a beautiful golden light emerges, revealing five sparkling jewels. As you read each chapter, imagine holding one of these beautiful jewels in your hand. As you study the jewel's brilliance coupled with the themes in each chapter, it is my hope that you, too, will discover a treasure trove of jewels that embody the golden years!"
